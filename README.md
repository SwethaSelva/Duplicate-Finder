# Duplicate-Finder
Duplicate Finder is a smart file deduplication tool that scans directories, detects duplicate files using SHA256 hashing, and safely moves them to a temporary Trash folder instead of immediate deletion. It helps optimize storage by removing redundant files without risking data loss.
